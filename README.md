# A/B Testing Analysis for Math and Statistics Course – Hyper Island

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that showcase A/B testing analyses for educational purposes. These notebooks were developed as part of the Math and Statistics course at Hyper Island. The scenarios and data used in these notebooks are entirely fictional and intended for practice and learning about A/B testing methodologies.

## Notebooks

Cooking Website A/B Test: This notebook simulates an A/B test for a cooking website. The test compares the effectiveness of two different product page layouts – a new vertical media rail design (Variant B) against the traditional horizontal layout (Variant A). The focus metrics include add-to-cart rate, clicks on media, cart abandonment rate, gross merchandise value (GMV), and purchases per user.

Pharmaceutical Company A/B Test: The second notebook presents a hypothetical scenario for a pharmaceutical company. It compares a new diabetes medication (Treatment group) with the current leading medication (Control group) to evaluate efficacy in blood sugar level management and the incidence of side effects.

## Objective

The primary objective of these notebooks is to provide a hands-on experience in conducting A/B tests and applying statistical analysis techniques. They are designed to help students understand the practical applications of statistics in business decision-making and pharmaceutical research.

## Data

Please note that all data presented in these notebooks are fictional and created solely for educational purposes. They are designed to resemble real-world scenarios and provide a realistic context for practicing statistical analysis techniques.
